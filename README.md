This project is a 3D space simulation built in C++ using modern OpenGL. It models hierarchical orbital motion where the Earth orbits the Sun and the Moon orbits the Earth. The simulation also includes real-time user interaction and a shooting mechanic that allows missiles to erase objects when user left-clicks and alligns the camera setup.

Features:
Sun, Earth, and Moon with hierarchical orbital motion
Keyboard-controlled movement (A/D = left/right, W/S = forward/backward)
Missile shooting system with object removal on impact
OBJ model loading
Texture mapping for realistic surfaces
Real-time 3D transformations using GLM

Technologies Used:
C++
OpenGL
GLEW
GLFW
GLM
stb_image (texture loading)
Custom OBJ Loader

Controls:
W / S – Move forward / backward
A / D – Move left / right
Left-click - Release missile
